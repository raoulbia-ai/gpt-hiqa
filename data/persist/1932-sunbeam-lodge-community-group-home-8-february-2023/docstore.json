quality and safety of care provided to the \nresidents living at Sunbeam Lodge. This centre had a risk inspection in April 2021 \nand a Regulation 27 infection prevention and control inspection in April 2022. In July \n2022, an NF30 notification was submitted as the provide r had recruited a new chief \nexecutive officer (CEO) who also acts as person participating in management (PPIM) \nfor this designated centre. The inspector found concerns in relation to the \ngovernance, management and oversight arrangements in place and a dete rioration \nin regulatory compliance, which impacted on the safety and well being of residents.  \nSunbeam Lodge is located on the edge of a busy town and next to two other \nbuildings which provide a respite service and a day service. At the time of \ninspection, the service provided support to three full -time residents with a range of \npresentations. This included support with behaviours of concern, high - support \nmedical care needs and end -of-life care.  \nThe property comprised a small bungalow with four bedrooms, a small kitchen, a \ndining room and a sitting room. The provider had planned to use one of the \nbedrooms as a second sitting room. However, there were concerns in relation to a \nleakage from the heating system in the house and its impact on one of the \nbedrooms provided. The resident sleeping there was required to move from this \nbedroom and into the smaller sitting room next door. The provider secured the \nservices of an environmental consultant who provided assurances on the safety of \nthe property and a plan of r epair was in progress. The person in charge told the \nprovider that they were examining other accommodation options for the residents \nshould they be required to move out during the remedial work period.  \nOn the afternoon of inspection, there were two residents at home. The third \nresident was at their day service which was located on the same site. The inspector \nmet briefly with one resident who was in their bed in their room. The staff on duty \ntold the inspector that their health had declined and that they were supported by \nthe palliative care team. The inspector found that the residents room was softly lit, \nwarm and cosy. The resident appeared comfortable in their bed and they had \npersonal items that they enjoyed nearby. Their interactions with staff m embers were \nkind, caring and respectful. Later that afternoon, the inspector had a short \nconversation with the resident\u2019s family members. They told the inspector that they \nwere very happy with the care and support provided in Sunbeam Lodge and that \nthey ap preciated the work of the staff.  \nA second resident returned to their home later in the afternoon.

This was sparsely decorated in \naccordance with their preferences and assessed needs. The resident did not speak \nwith the inspector. They were listening to music that  was playing on a television. \nLater, they were observed vocalising and moving from their bedroom to the kitchen \nand then back to their bedroom. They would take staff by the hand from time to \ntime. This resident did not have a formal day service. The staff on duty told the \ninspector that at times, they would pick up their footwear and show these to the \nstaff on duty. This meant that they wished to leave the centre. Staff told the \ninspector that they enjoyed long drives and that they provided these when asked . \nHowever, this was not always possible. Due to compatibility concerns, the resident \ndid not attend the day centre which was located nearby. However, the day centre \nwas vacant every second weekend and the resident was reported to enjoy going \nthere when it was vacant and quiet. The inspector found that the resident had \nlimited access to facilities for occupation and recreation. This will be expanded on \nlater in this report.  \nThe inspector observed the footfall in the centre throughout the day and found that \ndue to the assessed needs and presentation of residents and the number of people \nin the house, that the space provided was not sufficient.

In \naddition , one resident was moving around the house constantly and there were risks \nassociated with behaviours of concern escalating due to the lack of space. In \naddition, although there was a garden nearby, there was no garden attached to the \nproperty. This meant that when at home, the resident could not go outside \nindependently if they wished to do so.  \nFrom what the inspector observed during the inspection, it was clear that the \nresidents were provided with a good level of care and support. The staff on duty \nwere very familiar with the residents and able to adapt and provide for changes in \nresidents support needs if required.

This was reviewed on the day of inspection and some amendments were \nmade on the day. However, the inspector found that the floor plans were not \nupdated to reflect the change of use of the small sitting room to a bedroom. This \nwas not in line with the requirements of the Schedule 1 of the regulations and an \napplication to vary the registration conditions is required.  \nStaff had access to training, including refresher training, as part of a continuous \nprofessional development programme. Staff were provide d with a programme of \nformal supervision which was up to date. The inspector viewed a sample of training \nmodules and found that some refresher modules in relation to fire safety, moving \nand handling training and positive behaviour support training required  completion. \nStaff spoken were found to have good knowledge and understanding in relation to \nresidents needs and a plan was in place for outstanding training to be updated.  \nThe provider had ensured that the number, qualifications and skill mix of staff \nprovided was appropriate to the number and assessed needs of the residents. \nNursing care was provided and this meant that a resident with high support needs \ncould remain at home. The night -time arrangement in place was changed recently \nand waking support was provided. Furthermore, the staff team were found to be \nsupportive and responsive to residents\u2019 needs. For example, the person in charge \nexplained some changes to the roster on the day of inspection. This was due to the \nfact that one staff member agreed to go home and take a rest day. This meant that \nthey could fill an unanticipated vacancy on the roster that night and consistency of \ncare and support could be provided.  \nThe inspector found that the governance, management and oversight systems in \nplace failed to ensure that the service provided was safe, appropriate to the \nresidents needs and effectively monitored. The most recent annual review of the \nquality of care and support provided to residents took place in November 2021 and \ntherefore this required updat ing. The six monthly provider -led audit was last \ncompleted in February 2022 and therefore, this was due.

In addition, some audi ts were completed, but when reviewed by \nthe inspector, the information provided was not correct and requirement \namendment. For example, an audit on the restrictive practice register used in the \ncentre. Furthermore, risks in relation to positive behaviour s upport, resident \nsafeguarding and compatibility were not effectively monitored and addressed. \nNotifications in relation to safeguarding and protection were not submitted to the \nChief Inspector in accordance with the requirements of the regulations.  \nIn summary, although there was a defined management structure in place and a \ndedicated staff team, the systems in place to monitor the quality and safety of care \nprovided to the residents were not effective.

Therefore it \nwas not possible to ascertain when it had been reviewed. A second resident has a \nplan completed by the positive behaviour support therapist however, it required a \ncomprehensive review in  order to ensure that behaviour support strategies on the \nresidents file were clear, effective and in line with the safeguarding and protection \nrequirements of the service as a whole.  \nThe inspector found that the provider had not ensured that residents wer e protected \nfrom abuse and responsive measures had not been taken to address safeguarding \nissues in the centre. This related to incident report forms that were completed by \nstaff. There was a failure to recognise and act on occasions when there may be \ngrounds for concerns in relation to their peer\u2019s behaviours of concern. In addition, it \nrelated to the failure to update safeguarding plans when required. For example, a \nsafeguarding plan was in place and the safeguarding measures included the resident \neating their meals in the small sitting room from time to time. As this room was no \nlonger available, this safeguarding measure was no longer applicable. In addition, \nsafeguarding and protection audits were not effective as trends were not identified.  \nAs previously outlined, the inspector found significant concerns in relation to the \npremises. This included the fact that one of the bedrooms was closed to residents as \nthere was a substantial concern in relation to a leakage from the heating system. \nThis imp acted on the space provided in the property which was not sufficient for the \nrange and presentation of the residents living there. This meant that not all \nresidents were free to use all areas of their home at all times if they wished to do \nso. This was due  to the fact that there were safeguarding concerns in relation to a \nresident who like to move around the centre on a constant basis. In addition, there \nwas no secure outdoor space provided for the residents to use independently if they \nchoose to do so.  \nAs previously outlined above, one resident did not have access to a structured day \nservice. From a discussion with the staff on duty and a review of the residents care \nnotes, it was clear that they liked to go to the day centre at the weekends when it \nwas vac ant. However, this facility was available on two weekends per month only. \nFrom time to time, they would request to go for a drive on the bus. However, the \nstaff told the inspector that this was not always possible due other pressing \nrequirements in the ser vice. The inspector found that the resident did not have \nappropriate access to facilities for occupation and recreation and they were not \nsupported to participate in activities in accordance with their interests, capacities", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3643, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72670bd6-b7e3-4e02-81c8-70f4f885eea1": {"__data__": {"id_": "72670bd6-b7e3-4e02-81c8-70f4f885eea1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 451901, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72d3bd02-5775-42b1-8d52-9d26bbb24e47", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 451901, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "a0b2c6fa16fe7f4ad1d4bc89c28c6d81a936e0a8ebce6c018325f0c70598ed4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fd5c8cc-4ef4-496e-adcf-fb776ce4d2f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/1932-sunbeam-lodge-community-group-home-8-february-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 451901, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "eb72106f56506a4124f3a87db27a17c522aaff77cbbd6197d4371185120661a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c311b140-1995-4d42-95de-5f3a7a028e9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "25b6eea9e1cf7ef4402e1ea606c96f21ba1e493be4cdf89b32e60b6b939cd285", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 11 of 22 \n and developmental needs.
