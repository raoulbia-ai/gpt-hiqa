relation to infection prevention and \ncontrol (IPC). The inspection was completed over one day and during this time, the \ninspector met with residents and spoke with staff. In addition to discussions held, \nthe inspector observed the daily interactions and the lived experiences of  residents \nin this designated centre.  \nSunbeam Lodge was a bungalow located on a small campus close to a busy town. \nIn the past, this centre provided both residential and shared respite care. However, \ndue to the changing needs of the residents, respite care  is not currently provided. \nThe property visited by the inspector was nicely presented with residents' personal \nitems displayed. There was an entrance hall, a spacious sitting room and a separate \ndining room. To the rear of the dining area, there was a gal ley style kitchen with a \nserving hatch to the dining room. At the back door, there was a small area which \nwas used as a storage area for documents, medicines, and first aid and clinical \nequipment for example; giving sets and syringes. There were three bedr ooms in this \ndesignated centre, one of which had an en -suite toilet. There was a spare room \nprovided and on the day of inspection this was used to store equipment. There was \na large open plan bathroom with a shower trolley and a bath provided.  \nThe person i n charge was not on duty on the day of inspection. On arrival, the \ninspector was met by the senior staff nurse. They told the inspector that they \ntypically worked in the day service but provided support to the designated centre \nwhen required.  \nThe inspector  found that the provider had measures in place to prevent and manage \nthe risks associated with COVID -19. These included a system of temperature checks \nat the point of entry and a recording process which ensured that details of those \nthat entered the centre  were documented. The inspector noted that hand sanitiser \nwas available, along with a box of face masks and a pedal bin where masks were \ndiscarded after use. Hand washing facilities were available in the kitchen and in the \nbathroom. There was an adequate s upply of hand soap, paper towels and foot \noperated bins were provided. Staff were observed to be practicing good hand \nhygiene throughout the day and were wearing FFP2 face masks. There were \nsufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) availab le in the centre, \nincluding gloves, aprons, and both medical grade and FFP2 masks. In addition, the \ninspector noted that staff were completing routine cleaning tasks and that there was \na range of information posters relating to COVID -19 on display.  \nAll thr ee residents were in Sunbeam Lodge that morning. Although they did not \nspeak with the inspector,they were observed using some words and gestures with \nstaff in order to express their wishes and needs. The inspector noted that the \nresidents required a high l evel of support to ensure that a good standard of care \nwas provided.

They \nwere aware of the ri sks posed by healthcare associated infections, as well as \nunderstanding the risks associated with COVID -19. They had a good understanding \nof how to put a contingency plan in place and how to prevent the transmission of \ninfection. For example, one staff mem ber accurately described a resident\u2019s isolation \nplan and how to clean up and decontaminate a vomit spill if required. This was in \nline with the policy provided by the employer. Staff spoken with were also aware of \nthe appropriate use of PPE, however, later  in the day the inspector observed a staff \nmember wearing PPE while supporting a resident with their lunch. There was no \nclear rationale for this practice and no risks identified. Furthermore, this practice \nwas not in line with the plan of care that the pr ovider had in place for this resident \nand this required review.  \nThe inspector viewed the documentation maintained in the centre and found that \nthe annual review and the twice per year provider -led audit were completed in \naccordance with the regulations.

However, the \ninspector found that the policies, procedures  and guidelines required review to \nensure that they were fit for purpose and in line with up -to-date public health \nguidance. For example, the IPC policy required updating to ensure that it was in line \nwith current public health advice and the visitor guida nce on the front door required \nupdating. Secondly, a provider policy on care and management of percutaneous \nendoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and associated equipment was available.
