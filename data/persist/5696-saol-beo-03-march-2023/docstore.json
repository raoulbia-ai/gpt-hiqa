Due to concerns identified with \nthe premises provided, the residents moved to an alternative designated centre for a \nperiod last year, while works in relation to a water leak were completed. Residents \nreturned to Saol Beo in September 2022.  \nThe inspector had the opportunity to meet with all three residents during the course \nof the inspection. Due to their assessed communication needs, they did not hold \nconversations with the inspector but used words and gestures to communicate. In \naddition to meeting with residents, the inspector spent time speaking with the staff \nand reviewing documentation to gat her a sense of what it was like to live there.  \nOn arrival at the centre, the inspector met with a resident who was relaxing in the \nsitting room while the staff member on duty was preparing a hot lunch. The resident \nsmiled broadly when introduced to the ins pector. They used some words to speak \nabout their family and about staff members. At times, they used gestures to indicate \ntheir wishes. It was clear that the staff member on duty was very familiar with the \nresident\u2019s communication style and with their pre ferences. They were observed \nbeing very attentive to their needs and their interactions were caring, patient and \nrespectful.  \nThe residents at this centre did not attend a structured day centre. Instead, a \nprogramme of home based activities was organised ea ch day in line with the \nresidents\u2019 preferences. Later, the inspector observed the remaining two residents as \nthey returned on the bus from a community outing. The purpose of this activity was \nto take some furniture for repair, take a walk and to do some sh opping on the \njourney home. The residents did not speak with the inspector. However, they were \nobserved cheerfully returning to their home, interacting with staff and enjoying their \nmeal. It was clear that the residents living in Saol Beo had good opportun ities for \nsocial interactions and were actively engaged in their communities. In addition, staff \ntold the inspector that they were facilitated to maintain relationships with family and \nfriends where appropriate. There were no restrictions on visiting to th e centre at the \ntime of inspection.  \nThis designated centre comprised one property. The provider had a number of \nmeasures in place to assist with the prevention of infection and control of its spread. \nA walk around of the residents\u2019 home showed that signifi cant repairs had taken \nplace since the last inspection which ensured that matters relating to infection \nprevention and control were easier to attend to.

All staff were observed to be wearing face masks in line with the \nprovider\u2019s policy . The documentation held at the property was reviewed as part of \nthis inspection. The inspector found that improvements with some documentation \nsystems would enhance the infection prevention and control arrangements in place \nand this will be expanded on la ter in this report.  \nOverall, it was found that the residents living at Saol Beo appeared happy and \ncomfortable in their home. Systems were in place to ensure that infection prevention \nand control measures were provided and monitored. However, some actions were \nrequired to improve the documentation in place. This would ensure that the \ninfection prevention and control measures used were consistent with the Regulation \n27, the national standards and in line with the provider's own policy on infection \nprevention  and control.  \nThe next two sections of the report will discuss findings from the inspector\u2019s review \nof infection prevention and control measures in the centre. This will be presented \nunder two headings: Capacity and Capability and Quality and Safety.  \n \n \nCapacity and capability  \n  \n \n \nOverall, the inspector found that the registered provider had some systems in place \nto provide a safe service and to reduce the risk of healthcare -associated infections \nincluding COVID -19. However, some improvements were required with the \ndocumentation systems used which would further add to the effectiveness of the \nmeasures in place.  \nThere were clear lines of authority and accountability to ensure oversight of \ninfection prevention and control (IPC) measures in the centre. The centre was \nmanaged by a full -time person in charge. They were not available on the day of \ninspection. However, the  inspection was effectively facilitated by the staff member \non duty and by a manager who supported the role of person in charge. The person \nin charge was appointed as the COVID -19 lead in the centre. The centre was also \nsupported by a senior management tea m who were available to support if any \ninfection control or COVID -19 concerns arose.  \nInformation and guidance was available in the form of health and safety policies, \nprocedures and guidelines. However, the inspector found that some required review \nto ensu re that they were up to date. Furthermore, a streamlined system of \ndocumentation was required to ensure that the guidance provided was clear and \nthat they was no duplication.
