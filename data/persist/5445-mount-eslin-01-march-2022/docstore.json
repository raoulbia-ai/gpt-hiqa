They said that they had no complaints at present and that the y \ngot on well with their fellow residents.  \nIn conversation with staff, it was clear that staff were knowledgeable on the \nresidents\u2019 needs and preferences.

The provider had recently completed a recruitment \ncampaign  and three new members of staff were due to start in the centre in the \ncoming weeks. The service was led by social care workers. The person in charge \nreported that input from nursing staff was available on -call as required from the \nprovider\u2019s nursing team.   \nStaff training records were reviewed. Detailed training records were maintained in \nthe centre and dates when training was due to expire had been identified by the \nperson in charge. The provider had identified a number of modules that were \nmandatory for a ll staff. Staff training in these modules was mostly up to date. Two \nstaff members needed refresher training in managing behaviours that are \nchallenging. Dates for this refresher training had been identified. The relevant staff \nwere booked onto training co urses that were due to occur in the near future. In \naddition to the mandatory training, further training modules had been identified as \nnecessary for staff working in this centre. Residents\u2019 individual risk assessments \nlisted a number of training modules t hat were required to support certain residents. \nThe person in charge maintained a log in relation to additional training undertaken \nby staff. A review of these records indicated that staff were also up to date in the \nadditional training modules required to  support residents.  \nThe governance and management systems in the centre were robust. There was a \ndefined management structure and clear lines of accountability in the centre. A \nreview of the incident log found that incidents that occurred were escalated \nappropriately to senior management. Incidents were also referred to outside \nagencies as appropriate.  \nThe inspector reviewed the centre\u2019s most recent annual review of the quality and \nsafety of care and support in the centre. This was completed on 12/01/2021 . Six-\nmonthly unannounced audits were also completed in line with the regulations. The \nmost recent unannounced audit had occurred on 31/01/2022 and was conducted by \nthe provider\u2019s quality assurance officer. This audit thoroughly evaluated the service \ndelivered in the centre. Both the annual review and unannounced audit identified \nareas for service improvement in the centre. Recommendations with specific \ntimeframes for completion were devised based on the findings. It was noted that \nthe recommendations were implemented in line with these timeframes.
