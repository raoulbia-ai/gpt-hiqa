The inspection was c ompleted over one day and during this time, the \ninspector met with residents and spoke with staff. In addition to discussions held, \nthe inspector observed the daily interactions and the lived experiences of residents \nin this designated centre. The service was experiencing some challenges which were \nreviewed on this inspection, however the provider had arrangements in place to \nrespond to them, mitigating their impact on the quality and safety of the care \nprovided. These will be expanded on below. The residen ts were enjoying a good \nquality of life where their rights were respected and they were supported to \nparticipate in the running of their home and be involved in their communities.  \nArigna House is a bungalow located in a residential area close to busy villa ge. The \nentrance hall was bright and welcoming. The kitchen and dining room had new units \nfitted and the walls were painted. This was an improvement on the last inspection. \nThere was a comfortable sitting area in this room which one resident liked to use. A \nutility room was provided for the storage of cleaning products and the laundering of \nlinens and clothing. On the day of inspection, two bedrooms were occupied and \neach one had an en -suite bathroom. The bedrooms were comfortable and cheerfully \ndecorated. At the rear of the house there was a paved area for residents use and a \nshed for storage of equipment.  \nIn advance of the inspection, residents had completed questionnaires with the \nsupport of their family members. In general, the feedback from the resident s and \ntheir representatives said that they were happy in their home and with the quality of \nthe care and support provided. However, they raised some concerns in relation to \nstaffing levels, food and the use of the rooms provided. The inspector met with one  \nrepresentative on the day of inspection. They said that their family member felt safe \nin the service and that the staff were very good. In addition, they reiterated the \nconcerns outlined above which the inspector found were being addressed by the \nprovider  through their complaints procedure.  \nThe inspector met with both residents on the day of inspection. One resident \nattended a structured day service which was closed that day. Due to this they went \non an outing which included a visit to a beach with staff from the centre. On return, \nthey greeted the inspector. They were observed enjoying their evening meal and \nlater, relaxing in the sitting room with a foot spa treatment while watching \ntelevision.  \nThe second resident did not attend a structured day service.  Instead they \nparticipated in a range of home and community -based activities facilitated by the \ncentre\u2019s staff and directed by their choices. The staff on duty told the inspector that \non some days, the resident preferred to remain at home and if so, their wishes were", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3219, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f533fc6c-986f-4c87-a087-80dd0940551f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f533fc6c-986f-4c87-a087-80dd0940551f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387579, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7cba7198-41b3-49d8-84b5-a70ce8bd529d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387579, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "3a6851956aa39705510749c2761bcb1c46c972932112ad28cdc8a21c208090dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3397675f-8332-4044-9f3b-63c565f547cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_path": "../data/hiqa_pdfs/5684-arigna-house-14-august-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387579, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "92f8c039110a1de8652b86b69b94ed3598369a8fa847708b61874c117d5b22a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "beab31c9-9205-472a-a774-dcb8e7c28532", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b990458310929cc8e804ac740cb0c45d7f1bf76dfd19fdd561d1210a2b08a22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 6 of 14 \n respected.  \nThe inspector met with the staff members on duty on the day of inspection.
