\nadditional inspection conducted by a separate inspector in 2022 which found that a \ngood standard of care was provided. The inspector on this inspection, noted a \nmarked and significant improvement in both the quality and safety of care had been \nsustained within the centre and overall the centre was both warm and welcoming in \nnature. On previous inspections there had been a large volume o f safeguarding \nconcerns and the inspection of 2021 found that the centre had a tense atmosphere \nwith staff members on alert for any negative interactions which may occur. \nHowever, on this inspection the centre had a very pleasant atmosphere and \nresidents w ent about their own affairs throughout the day. Music was playing in the \nbackground for the day and staff and residents were observed to stop and chat as \nthey went about their day. There were no negative interactions observed and staff \nwho met with the ins pector clearly outlined residents' preferences in regards to care. \nAlthough some safeguarding concerns remained, incidents of a safeguarding nature \nhad reduced in both frequency and intensity and it was clear that the person in the \ncharge and the staff tea m were working to ensure that safeguarding was promoted.  \nThe inspector met with all residents who were using this service on the day of \ninspection. Three of the residents preferred not to speak with the inspector for any \nlength of time and the three remain ing residents spent a period of time chatting \nabout their lives and the support which was offered to them. Two residents met \nindividually with the inspector in a communal reception room and they spoke freely \nabout the care and support they each received. B oth residents complimented the \nstaff team and the person in charge and they explained that they had no \nreservations in discussing with staff any concerns which they may have.  \nOne resident explained how they planned to visit their family later in the day and \nthat they planned to stop for breakfast enroute. They explained how they enjoyed \nspending time in the centre and they had every opportunity to get out and about in \nthe local community. They discussed their life before moving to the centre and they \nexplained that it was a very positive move for them. The second resident also spoke \nat length about their life and again they discussed how moving to the centre had \nenhanced their wellbeing and welfare. They had a love of soccer and they chatted \nabout their fa vourite team and they proudly wore their team's colours. They planned \nto go out with the support of staff later that day and maybe place a bet on an \nupcoming soccer match.
