Signage was \navailable in easy -to-read formats which supported residents\u2019 understanding.  \nSuitable facilities for hand hygiene were available throughout the centre. These \nincluded a number of hand washing sinks, with soap, towels and foot operated bins \nprovided. Hand sanitiser was available at entrances and in the kitchen.

They acted as the Lead Worker \nRepresentative under the COVID -19 Return to Work Safely Protocol (Health and \nSafety Au thority, 2020). The clinical nurse manager was present and this showed \nthat there was a clear deputising arrangement in place. The person in charge told \nthe inspector that there was an adequate team of staff available to support the \nresidents. Furthermore,  an on call cover arrangement was in place with consistent \nrelief staff available if required.  \nStaff spoken with were aware of the risks posed by healthcare associated infections, \nas well as understanding the risks associated with COVID -19. They had a good  \nunderstanding of how to prevent the transmission of infection and of how to \nmanage risk laundry and risk waste effectively. Furthermore, they were aware of \nhow to put an isolation plan in place if required and they told the inspector that they \nhad used th is recently. However, from a review of the documentation and discussion \nwith staff, the inspector found that the locations used to don and doff PPE were not \nin line with the isolation plan that the provider had in place. This required review.  \nThe provider had ensured that staff had access to training and support as part of a \ncontinuous professional development programme. This included access to a range of \nIPC training modules. For example, infection prevention and control training, \ntraining on hand hygiene,  use of personal protective equipment and COVID -19 \noutbreak management. A review of the training matrix provided evidence and \ntraining was completed as required and was up to date.  \nThere was a comprehensive list of IPC audit tools in use in this designated  centre. \nThese included health and safety audits and daily, weekly and enhanced cleaning \naudits for the centre.
