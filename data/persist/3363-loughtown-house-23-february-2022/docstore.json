One resident told the inspector that they felt \u201cvery happy\u201d and \n\u201csafe\u201d in their home. They spoke about the residents\u2019 meetings which took place \neach week and they told the inspector that meals were planned and trips were \norganised at these meetings. Furthermore, residents were aware of the risks in \nrelation to COVID -19 and told the inspector about their dislike of the virus and the \nimportance of hand hygiene. Later in the day, two residents were observed \ncompleting chores in the kitchen together. There was a companionable and \nsupportive atmosphere betwe en them and they were observed to be kind to each \nother.  \nThis designated centre was a bungalow which was located in a residential area close \nto a busy town.

The residents showed the \ninspector new wardrobes which were recently installed. One bedroom had an e n-\nsuite and this was clean and organised.
