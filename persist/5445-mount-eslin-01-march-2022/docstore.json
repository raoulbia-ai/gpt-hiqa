The inspection was scheduled as a result of a number of \nincidents that had been reported to the Health Information and Quality Authority \n(HIQA) in line with the regulations. As the focus of this inspection was narrow, the \nbuilding was not inspected and the inspector did not have the opport unity to spend \ntime with all residents. Overall, the inspector found that there was good governance \nand management in the centre that resulted in a safe, good -quality service.  \nThe centre was a two -storey house in a rural location. It consisted of a main ho use \nwhere each resident had their own bedroom with en -suite bathroom. There was a \nshared kitchen and living rooms. The centre also had two self -contained apartments \nwithin the building.  \nThe inspector met with one resident who reported that they were happy living in the \ncentre. When the inspector asked them about the centre, they said it was \u2018great\u2019. \nThey said that they could raise any issues with staff and would be comfortable \nmaking a complaint. They said that they had no complaints at present and that the y \ngot on well with their fellow residents.  \nIn conversation with staff, it was clear that staff were knowledgeable on the \nresidents\u2019 needs and preferences. Staff could identify behaviours that indicated that \nresidents were calm or beginning to become anxious or distressed. They were aware \nof the strategies that should be used to support residents with their behaviour. They \nwere knowledgeable on the residents\u2019 healthcare needs, their interests and hobbies. \nStaff were noted interacting with residents in a friendly and caring manner. Staff \nwere respectful when they spoke about the residents.  \nThe next two sections of the report present the findings of this inspection in relation \nto the governance and management arrangements in the centre and how these \narrangements impacted on the quality and safety of the service being delivered to \nresidents.  \n \n \nCapacity and capability  \n  \n \n \nThe focus of the inspection was in relation to risk, specifically in regards to \nsafeguarding residents and managing behaviours that are challenging. Overall, the \ninspector found a very good level of compliance in this area. There was good \nmanagement and ov ersight of the centre. Staffing arrangements and staff training \nwere appropriate to meet the needs of residents to ensure their safety and to \n\n \nPage 6 of 11 \n support them manage behaviours that were challenging.  \nThe inspection was facilitated by the person in charge and the team leader who was \non duty at the time of the inspection.

Agency staff was not required as there were adequate staff numbers \nto cover periods of leave. The provider had recently completed a recruitment \ncampaign  and three new members of staff were due to start in the centre in the \ncoming weeks. The service was led by social care workers. The person in charge \nreported that input from nursing staff was available on -call as required from the \nprovider\u2019s nursing team.   \nStaff training records were reviewed. Detailed training records were maintained in \nthe centre and dates when training was due to expire had been identified by the \nperson in charge. The provider had identified a number of modules that were \nmandatory for a ll staff. Staff training in these modules was mostly up to date. Two \nstaff members needed refresher training in managing behaviours that are \nchallenging. Dates for this refresher training had been identified. The relevant staff \nwere booked onto training co urses that were due to occur in the near future. In \naddition to the mandatory training, further training modules had been identified as \nnecessary for staff working in this centre. Residents\u2019 individual risk assessments \nlisted a number of training modules t hat were required to support certain residents. \nThe person in charge maintained a log in relation to additional training undertaken \nby staff. A review of these records indicated that staff were also up to date in the \nadditional training modules required to  support residents.  \nThe governance and management systems in the centre were robust. There was a \ndefined management structure and clear lines of accountability in the centre. A \nreview of the incident log found that incidents that occurred were escalated \nappropriately to senior management. Incidents were also referred to outside \nagencies as appropriate.  \nThe inspector reviewed the centre\u2019s most recent annual review of the quality and \nsafety of care and support in the centre. This was completed on 12/01/2021 . Six-\nmonthly unannounced audits were also completed in line with the regulations. The \nmost recent unannounced audit had occurred on 31/01/2022 and was conducted by \nthe provider\u2019s quality assurance officer. This audit thoroughly evaluated the service \ndelivered in the centre. Both the annual review and unannounced audit identified \nareas for service improvement in the centre. Recommendations with specific \ntimeframes for completion were devised based on the findings. It was noted that \nthe recommendations were implemented in line with these timeframes. For \n\n \nPage 7 of 11 \n example, the annual review identified that trends regarding incidents that occurred \nin the centre should be communicated to all staff. It was noted that incidents and \nincident trends were included as agenda it ems in staff meetings and in the staff \ndaily handover notes.  \nThere was clear communication between management and staff. A handover \nmeeting and document was completed at the beginning of each day. This provided \nstaff with information on any recent issues regarding the residents\u2019 health or social \nneeds, a general out line of events happening that day, and any learning from \nincidents that had occurred in the previous week.

In response to this, the service had a centre -\nspecific safeguarding plan. This plan provided an overview and analysis of the \nsafeguarding risks in the centre and the vulnerabilities of residents. The \nsafeguarding plan identified trends in times and situations where negative \ninteractions and safeguarding risks increased. Preventative measures to reduce the \nrisks were identified. The plan was reviewed and updated monthly. Staff signed the \nplan to show that t hey had read it and were familiar with its content. In addition to \nthis, there was a number of open safeguarding plans in place for some residents. A \nreview of incidents found that safeguarding incidents were reported to the national \nsafeguarding team as a ppropriate and this informed the safeguarding plans in the \ncentre. There was comprehensive documentation in relation to adverse incidents. \nThis included a record of the event, immediate actions, planned follow -up actions \nand an analysis of trends.  \nResident s were supported to manage their behaviour. Where required, written \nguidance was provided to staff to outline how to support residents maintain calm \nbehaviours and how to respond if residents became anxious or agitated. There was \ninput from relevant profes sionals in the development of behaviour support plans. \nThis included behavioural specialists and psychiatry. Plans were regularly reviewed \nand updated.
