There were concerns in relation to the \nwelfare of the residents and the safety of the service provided. Further to t his, a \nwarning meeting was held with the provider during which the provider was put on \nnotice of the enforcement action that would be initiated should they fail to address \nthe areas of non -compliance and areas of risk identified.  \nIn response to the finding s of the February inspection, the provider submitted a \ncompliance plan which detailed the actions that they planned to take in order to \nbring the centre into compliance. The purpose of this inspection was to assess the \nprovider\u2019s capacity and capability to  complete the actions required and to sustain an \nongoing response in order to return to and maintain compliance with the Care and \nSupport Regulations (2013). On this inspection, inspectors found improvement in \nthe capacity of the provider to ensure effecti ve oversight of the service and \nimprovement in the safety of the care provided. However, ongoing work was to \nensure that residents living in this designated centre were compatible with each \nother and to ensure that risks associated with compatibility were managed \neffectively. In addition, some improvements with training arrangements and the \npremises provided would further enhance the quality and safety of the service \nprovided.  \nSunbeam Lodge comprises one property located close to a busy town. It is located \non a small campus which includes a respite service and a day service. The property \nprovided is three bedroom bungalow, one of which has an en -suite. The inspectors \nfound that concerns raised in relation to the premises at the time of the February \ninspectio n were addressed in the main. The floor covering was replaced and the \nwalls were freshly painted. These matters will be further outlined under regulation \n17 below. Overall, the property was clean, tidy and welcoming. Residents had \naccess to a second sittin g room which offered a choice of places to sit and relax or \nto spend time with their visitors. In addition, the provider was looking at options for \na suitable outdoor space for use by the residents in Sunbeam House and in \nparticular for a resident who may benefit from the use of a dedicated garden space.  \nOn arrival at the centre, the inspectors met with two healthcare assistants on duty \nand two staff nurses later in the afternoon. They told the inspectors that the person \nin charge was not available on the d ay of inspection, however, the person \nparticipating in management (PPIM) was available. They arrive later.  \nOn the afternoon of inspection, there were two residents residing in Sunbeam \nLodge. This was a reduction in number since the last inspection.
