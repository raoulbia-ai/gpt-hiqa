Also, on examination, the sharps bin was open, h ad not \nbeen emptied and contained both sharps and general waste items. With regard to \nthe cleaning arrangements in place, the inspector observed colour coded posters on \ndisplay which showed the colour of cleaning cloths, mops and buckets to be used for \neach area e.g. for the kitchen and the bathroom. However, the inspector found that \nthese colour coded cleaning items were not provided in line with the protocol and \ntherefore the protocol was not effective. For example, there was no green mop \nbucket for use i n the kitchen and although cleaning cloths were provided the colours \ndid not correspond with the posters provided.  \nOverall, the inspector found that residents at Loughtown House were supported with \ntheir individual needs and a good standard of care was pro vided.
