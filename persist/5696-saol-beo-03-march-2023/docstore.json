Due to concerns identified with \nthe premises provided, the residents moved to an alternative designated centre for a \nperiod last year, while works in relation to a water leak were completed. Residents \nreturned to Saol Beo in September 2022.  \nThe inspector had the opportunity to meet with all three residents during the course \nof the inspection. Due to their assessed communication needs, they did not hold \nconversations with the inspector but used words and gestures to communicate. In \naddition to meeting with residents, the inspector spent time speaking with the staff \nand reviewing documentation to gat her a sense of what it was like to live there.  \nOn arrival at the centre, the inspector met with a resident who was relaxing in the \nsitting room while the staff member on duty was preparing a hot lunch. The resident \nsmiled broadly when introduced to the ins pector. They used some words to speak \nabout their family and about staff members. At times, they used gestures to indicate \ntheir wishes. It was clear that the staff member on duty was very familiar with the \nresident\u2019s communication style and with their pre ferences. They were observed \nbeing very attentive to their needs and their interactions were caring, patient and \nrespectful.  \nThe residents at this centre did not attend a structured day centre. Instead, a \nprogramme of home based activities was organised ea ch day in line with the \nresidents\u2019 preferences. Later, the inspector observed the remaining two residents as \nthey returned on the bus from a community outing. The purpose of this activity was \nto take some furniture for repair, take a walk and to do some sh opping on the \njourney home. The residents did not speak with the inspector. However, they were \nobserved cheerfully returning to their home, interacting with staff and enjoying their \nmeal. It was clear that the residents living in Saol Beo had good opportun ities for \nsocial interactions and were actively engaged in their communities. In addition, staff \ntold the inspector that they were facilitated to maintain relationships with family and \nfriends where appropriate. There were no restrictions on visiting to th e centre at the \ntime of inspection.  \nThis designated centre comprised one property. The provider had a number of \nmeasures in place to assist with the prevention of infection and control of its spread. \nA walk around of the residents\u2019 home showed that signifi cant repairs had taken \nplace since the last inspection which ensured that matters relating to infection \nprevention and control were easier to attend to. These included freshly painted walls \n\n \nPage 6 of 14 \n and new flooring which was reported to be easier to keep clean. A safety pause \nsystem was in place at the entry and exit door.

This would ensure that the \ninfection prevention and control measures used were consistent with the Regulation \n27, the national standards and in line with the provider's own policy on infection \nprevention  and control.  \nThe next two sections of the report will discuss findings from the inspector\u2019s review \nof infection prevention and control measures in the centre. This will be presented \nunder two headings: Capacity and Capability and Quality and Safety.  \n \n \nCapacity and capability  \n  \n \n \nOverall, the inspector found that the registered provider had some systems in place \nto provide a safe service and to reduce the risk of healthcare -associated infections \nincluding COVID -19. However, some improvements were required with the \ndocumentation systems used which would further add to the effectiveness of the \nmeasures in place.  \nThere were clear lines of authority and accountability to ensure oversight of \ninfection prevention and control (IPC) measures in the centre. The centre was \nmanaged by a full -time person in charge. They were not available on the day of \ninspection. However, the  inspection was effectively facilitated by the staff member \non duty and by a manager who supported the role of person in charge. The person \nin charge was appointed as the COVID -19 lead in the centre. The centre was also \nsupported by a senior management tea m who were available to support if any \ninfection control or COVID -19 concerns arose.  \nInformation and guidance was available in the form of health and safety policies, \nprocedures and guidelines. However, the inspector found that some required review \nto ensu re that they were up to date. Furthermore, a streamlined system of \ndocumentation was required to ensure that the guidance provided was clear and \nthat they was no duplication. The provider had a COVID -19 folder which was \n\n \nPage 7 of 14 \n reviewed by the inspector. This incl uded easy -to-read guidance for residents use. \nHowever, although written guidelines and protocols were in place, some required \nreview to ensure that they were in line with current public health guidelines. In \naddition, the isolation plan used for residents during an outbreak of infection \nrequired updating to ensure that it provided guidance on the specific isolation \narrangements in place for each resident. For example, the zoning arrangements for \nuse if a resident was unable to isolate and the bathroom arran gements in place for \nresidents that did not have en -suite facilities provided.  \nThe provider had arrangements in place to assess, monitor and review its \nperformance in relation to infections prevention and control. An audit system was in \nplace. Daily and we ekly cleaning schedules were used and were found to be up to \ndate. Enhanced cleaning and wiping down was used as required. Team meetings \nwere taking place on fortnightly basis. These provided an opportunity for staff to \ndiscuss and review IPC matters if re quired and staff spoken with told the inspector \nthat they were supportive. Staff training requirements were reviewed and although \nnot available at the centre on the day of inspection, IPC specific modules were \nreported to be up to date.  \nThe inspector found  that the staffing arrangements in place were appropriate to the \nassessed needs of the residents living at the centre.

However, some improvements were \nrequired with the documentation used to ensure best practice with I PC measures \nwere consistently adhered to.  \nThe residents living at Saol Beo had a range of assessed needs and access to \nhealthcare services were facilitated as required. This included attendance at general \n\n \nPage 8 of 14 \n practitioner (GP) appointments and visits from alli ed health professionals such as \noccupational therapy (OT) as required.  \nThe inspector found that infection prevention and control practices were part of the \nday-to-day routine in this designated centre. Staff were wearing face masks and \nwere observed practi cing hand hygiene at appropriate intervals throughout the \ninspection. The residents in this designated centre lived there full -time and there \nwere no vacancies. Therefore, there was no requirement for specific IPC \narrangements in relation to admissions, di scharge or transfers out of the service.  \nAs outlined above, the residents had returned to live in Saol Beo and after \nmaintenance work was completed. The inspector found that the premises provided \nwas spacious and accessible for the residents living there. It was clean and tidy and \nin a very good state of repair. The floor covering was new, the walls were clean and \nfreshly painted and there was a new suite of furniture in the sitting room. The staff \non duty told the inspector about the arrangements used to i dentify maintenance \nrequirements and of how to progress their completion. For example, the dining \nroom chairs had some wear and tear evident and were difficult to keep clean. The \nprovider had arranged for their repair and they were dropped off on the morni ng of \ninspection. This meant that the maintenance systems used were working well.  \nThe inspector reviewed the staff handover folder and found that it contained a \nhandover sheet with a number of daily checks in place. These included cleaning \nschedules as out lined previously in this report. There was a number of pieces of \nequipment in use in this centre and arrangements were in place to ensure that they \nwere kept clean. No equipment was shared by residents. The handover folder also \nhad a COVID -19 self -declarat ion form which was completed by the staff on duty. \nHowever, this required review to ensure that it was up to date with current public \nhealth advice at the time of inspection.  \nStaff spoken with described the systems used for the laundering of linens and \nclothing.
