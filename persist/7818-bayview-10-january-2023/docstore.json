There was a well equipped kitchen and a \nseparate dining room nearby. T here were two sitting rooms provided. One at the \nfront of the property which was cheerfully decorated with pictures and photographs. \nThe second sitting room was located at the rear of the property. It had a large \ntelevision and staff told the inspector tha t this was used as a \u2018cinema room\u2019. There \nwas a small desk in this room which was used to store residents\u2019 files and for the \ncompletion of administrative tasks. The main office was located in the garage space. \nThis was an action required from a previous in spection and was completed by the \nprovider. Each resident had their own bedroom, two of which were en -suite. A \nspacious bathroom with a wet room space for showering was provided for the use of \nthe other residents.  \nThere were four residents at this designat ed centre on the day of inspection. On \narrival, the residents were enjoying breakfast in the dining room. They spoke with \nthe inspector about time spent at home at Christmas and time spent with family \nmembers. One resident was observed joking with a staff member and they laughed \ncheerfully together. Other residents spoke about their preferred daily activities which \nincluded attending planned community based activities such as a local women\u2019s \ngroup and a \u2018social farming\u2019 activity. Other outings were planned by residents at \ntheir residents\u2019 meetings and on a day to day basis depending on what they choose \nto do. The inspector met with a staff member who had the responsibility for co -\nordinating activities on the day of inspection. Activities included trips to th e library, \naqua aerobics and doing yoga classes. Residents had a range of communication \nstyles and it was evident that the staff on duty knew the residents and their \ncommunication needs very well. Interactions between residents and staff were \nobserved to b e kind, caring and respectful.  \nLater that morning, two residents invited the inspector to visit their bedrooms. They \nwere observed to be warm, comfortable and cheerfully decorated. One resident \nspoke briefly with the inspector. They said that they liked th eir bedroom and that \nthey were happy in their home. They told the inspector that they felt safe and if \nthey felt worried at any time that they could speak with staff.  \n\n \nPage 6 of 17 \n Shortly afterwards, the residents left the designated centre to attend community \nactiviti es and to go out for lunch.
