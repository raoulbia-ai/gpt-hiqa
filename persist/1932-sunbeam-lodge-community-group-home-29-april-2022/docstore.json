Leitrim. It provides seven day accommodation to male and female \nadults with a moderate to profound intellectual disability who also present with \nepilepsy, behaviours of concern, mental health diagnoses, hypothyroidism, \nosteoporosis, mobility impairment, cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder. \nSunbeam Lodge can accommodate three service -users at any one time. The house is \nstaffed by nurses and healthcare assistants according t o the dependency levels of \nthe residents, and a waking night and sleepover cover is in place each night. The \ncentre comprises of 3 bedrooms ( one of which is en suite), a bathroom, kitchen, \nutility room, dining room and sitting room.  \n \n \nThe following info rmation outlines some additional data on this centre.  \n \n \n \n \n  Number of residents on the \ndate of inspection:  3 \n\n \nPage 3 of 13 \n How we inspect  \n \nThis inspection was carried out to assess compliance with the Health Act 2007 (as \namended) , the Health Act 2007 (Care and Support of Residents in Designated \nCentres for Persons (Children and Adults) with Disabilities) Regulations 2013 , and the \nHealth Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Persons (Children and \nAdults) with Disabilities) Regulations 2013 (as amende d).

The inspection was completed over one day and during this time, the \ninspector met with residents and spoke with staff. In addition to discussions held, \nthe inspector observed the daily interactions and the lived experiences of  residents \nin this designated centre.  \nSunbeam Lodge was a bungalow located on a small campus close to a busy town. \nIn the past, this centre provided both residential and shared respite care. However, \ndue to the changing needs of the residents, respite care  is not currently provided. \nThe property visited by the inspector was nicely presented with residents' personal \nitems displayed. There was an entrance hall, a spacious sitting room and a separate \ndining room. To the rear of the dining area, there was a gal ley style kitchen with a \nserving hatch to the dining room. At the back door, there was a small area which \nwas used as a storage area for documents, medicines, and first aid and clinical \nequipment for example; giving sets and syringes. There were three bedr ooms in this \ndesignated centre, one of which had an en -suite toilet. There was a spare room \nprovided and on the day of inspection this was used to store equipment. There was \na large open plan bathroom with a shower trolley and a bath provided.  \nThe person i n charge was not on duty on the day of inspection. On arrival, the \ninspector was met by the senior staff nurse. They told the inspector that they \ntypically worked in the day service but provided support to the designated centre \nwhen required.  \nThe inspector  found that the provider had measures in place to prevent and manage \nthe risks associated with COVID -19. These included a system of temperature checks \nat the point of entry and a recording process which ensured that details of those \nthat entered the centre  were documented. The inspector noted that hand sanitiser \nwas available, along with a box of face masks and a pedal bin where masks were \ndiscarded after use. Hand washing facilities were available in the kitchen and in the \nbathroom. There was an adequate s upply of hand soap, paper towels and foot \noperated bins were provided. Staff were observed to be practicing good hand \nhygiene throughout the day and were wearing FFP2 face masks. There were \nsufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) availab le in the centre, \nincluding gloves, aprons, and both medical grade and FFP2 masks. In addition, the \ninspector noted that staff were completing routine cleaning tasks and that there was \na range of information posters relating to COVID -19 on display.  \nAll thr ee residents were in Sunbeam Lodge that morning. Although they did not \nspeak with the inspector,they were observed using some words and gestures with \nstaff in order to express their wishes and needs. The inspector noted that the \nresidents required a high l evel of support to ensure that a good standard of care \nwas provided. A discussion with the staff nurse on duty provided further information \n\n \nPage 6 of 13 \n on the residents assessed needs and the nursing supports that the provider had in \nplace to ensure that a safe servic e was provided.  \nThe inspector observed the activities taking place in the centre on the day of \ninspection and the interactions between staff and residents. One resident was \nleaving to attend their day service. A second resident was sitting in the lounge. T he \nstaff nurse told the inspector that they had a recent hospital admission and were \nrecovering. The third resident was observed sitting on their bed and listening to \nmusic.

Due to the current \nhealth needs of so me residents, their trips to the community were reported to be \nlimited at that time.  \nIn summary, Sunbeam Lodge provided comfortable living accommodation for the \nresidents where systems were in place to prevent and control the spread of \ninfection. The next two sections of the report present the findings of this inspection \nin relation to the governance and management arrangements in place in the centre, \nand how these arrangements impacted on the quality and safety of the service \nbeing delivered.  \n \n \nCapacity and capability  \n  \n \n \nThe inspector found that good governance structures in relation to IPC were in place \nin this designated centre and clear reporting relationships were in place. The person \nin charge held overall responsibility for the oversight of the infection prevention and \ncontrol measures in place. They acted as the Lead Worker Representative under the \nCOVID -19 Return to Work Safely Protocol (Health and Safety Authority, 2020). As \npreviously stated, they were not present on the day of inspection, however, it was \nclear that the provider had an appropriate cover arrangement in place. The nurse on \nduty was found to be experienced, had good oversight of the centre, was known to \nthe residents and knowledgeable of their needs. The inspector reviewed an outbreak \nof COVID -19 which occurred recently with the nurse on duty. They described the \ncontingency plan that was used and the residents\u2019 experiences. They told the \ninspector that the contingency plan worked well and that a meeting wa s scheduled \nfor the future, during which learning could be identified which would inform future \narrangements.  \nA review of the staff roster showed that adequate staffing arrangements were in \nplace in order to support the residents and the infection preventi on and control \noversight in the service. However, improvements were required in how the roster \nwas documented. For example, full names would assist with clarity and changes that \nhad taken place were not recorded accurately.  \nStaff had access to infection pr evention and control training as part of a programme \n\n \nPage 7 of 13 \n of continuous professional development. Modules included; introduction to infection \nprevention and control, hand hygiene training, breaking the chain of infection, \ndonning and doffing PPE and COVID -19 as sessment and recognition for people with \nintellectual disabilities. Certificates of completion were available for review and were \nfound to be up to date.  \nThe inspector spoke with two healthcare assistants on the day of inspection. They \nwere aware of the ri sks posed by healthcare associated infections, as well as \nunderstanding the risks associated with COVID -19. They had a good understanding \nof how to put a contingency plan in place and how to prevent the transmission of \ninfection. For example, one staff mem ber accurately described a resident\u2019s isolation \nplan and how to clean up and decontaminate a vomit spill if required. This was in \nline with the policy provided by the employer. Staff spoken with were also aware of \nthe appropriate use of PPE, however, later  in the day the inspector observed a staff \nmember wearing PPE while supporting a resident with their lunch. There was no \nclear rationale for this practice and no risks identified. Furthermore, this practice \nwas not in line with the plan of care that the pr ovider had in place for this resident \nand this required review.  \nThe inspector viewed the documentation maintained in the centre and found that \nthe annual review and the twice per year provider -led audit were completed in \naccordance with the regulations.

However, the \ninspector found that the policies, procedures  and guidelines required review to \nensure that they were fit for purpose and in line with up -to-date public health \nguidance. For example, the IPC policy required updating to ensure that it was in line \nwith current public health advice and the visitor guida nce on the front door required \nupdating. Secondly, a provider policy on care and management of percutaneous \nendoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and associated equipment was available. However, a \nreview of documents in this regard found that there were a range of guidances \nprovided. These included a policy as above, a plan of care on the residents file and a \nguidance poster displayed on the wall. All of which provided conflicting advice on \nthe use, reuse and disposal of PEG equipment and were not in line with the \npractices viewed on the day of inspection.  \nA centre specific risk register was in place and risks associated with IPC were \nidentified and control measures were in place. Some residents had up -to-date \nindividual risk assessments on file however others required review. The provider had \nensured that there were a range of audit tools available to measure adherence to \nthe control measures identified. These included a daily safety pause and \ntemperature check, daily and weekly cleaning schedules, a monthly ho use keeping \naudit and a monthly first aid box audit. However, on review of the auditing systems \nin place, the inspector found that some improvements were required, as not all \naudits were effective at all times. For example, a significant number of items in  the \nfirst aid required replacement.  \nThe next section of this report explores how the governance and oversight \narrangements outlined above affects the quality and safety of the service being \n\n \nPage 8 of 13 \n provided.  \n \n \nQuality and safety  \n  \n \n \nThe residents in this designated centre used non -verbal communication and staff \nwere observed to be familiar with their individual communication styles. Residents \nwere provided with information regarding IPC in line with their level of \nunderstanding. For example, an easy -to-read poster was on display which explained \nwhy staff wore PPE. The staff on duty told the inspector that where possible family \nmembers assisted with decisions required in relation to IPC for example, COVID -19 \ntesting, i solation plans and vaccinations.  \nResidents had individual nursing assessments and care plans in place. As previously \noutlined, one resident had a recent hospital admission. The inspector found that \nthere was a comprehensive plan of care in place which redu ced the risks of \ntransmission based infection from the acute setting to the designated centre. This \nplan was reviewed with the staff nurse and it was found to be effective.  \nOther nursing care plans reviewed provided evidence of multi -disciplinary input for  \nexample, dietetic assessments, occupational therapy visits, and assessment and \nguidance from the speech and language therapist. Residents had access to their \ngeneral practitioner (GP) when required and there was evidence of attendance at \nchiropody service s, dental services and contact with the tissue viability specialist. On \nthe day of inspection, plans were underway for one resident to attend a hospital for \na medical assessment. This was due to take place the following week.  \nThe inspector found that the s taff on duty had knowledge of the standard \nprecautions required to prevent and control the spread of infection and there were \nsystems and processes in place to ensure that IPC was part of the routine delivery \nof care. For example, staff were observed using  colour coded mops to clean target \nareas and an appropriate mop storage system was in use.

There was an \nadequate supply of cleaning products, dissolvable laundry bags and risk and non -risk \nwaste disposal bags available and staff were aware of how to use these.  \nA walk around of the centre showed that the premises was clean and tidy. The walls \nand floors were in  a good state of repair, however frequently touched areas such as \nthe doors required attention. The curtains in the sitting room were very clean and \nthere was a leather suite of furniture provided. Although the fabric was intact, there \nwere signs of wear a nd tear on the seats and the arm rests. The bathroom was well \npresented however, the panel on the side of the bath required repair. The inspector \n\n \nPage 9 of 13 \n noted that each resident had an individual basin used for intimate care and one of \nthese was visibly stained a nd required cleaning.
