The entrance hall was bright and welcoming. There was a large kitchen \nand dining room where residents\u2019 meals were prepared. Beside this, there was a \nutility room for the storage of bathing and cleaning produc ts and the laundering of \nlinen and clothing. There was a sitting room at the front of the house and a sun \nroom at the side. This meant that residents had space to spend time apart if they \nchoose to do so. Upstairs there were four bedrooms, two of which wer e en-suite. \nThere was a garden at the rear of the house where the bins were stored neatly with \nthe lids closed.  \nOn arrival at the designated centre, the inspector found that the provider had \nmeasures in place to prevent and manage the risks associated with  COVID -19. \nThese included hand santisers provided at the point of entry, a system of \ntemperature checks and a recording process which ensured that relevant details of \nthose that entered the centre were documented.

The clinical nurse manager was present and this showed \nthat there was a clear deputising arrangement in place.

This included access to a range of \nIPC training modules. For example, infection prevention and control training, \ntraining on hand hygiene,  use of personal protective equipment and COVID -19 \noutbreak management.
