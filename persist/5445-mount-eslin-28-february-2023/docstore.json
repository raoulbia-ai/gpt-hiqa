The inspector on this inspection, noted a \nmarked and significant improvement in both the quality and safety of care had been \nsustained within the centre and overall the centre was both warm and welcoming in \nnature. On previous inspections there had been a large volume o f safeguarding \nconcerns and the inspection of 2021 found that the centre had a tense atmosphere \nwith staff members on alert for any negative interactions which may occur. \nHowever, on this inspection the centre had a very pleasant atmosphere and \nresidents w ent about their own affairs throughout the day. Music was playing in the \nbackground for the day and staff and residents were observed to stop and chat as \nthey went about their day. There were no negative interactions observed and staff \nwho met with the ins pector clearly outlined residents' preferences in regards to care. \nAlthough some safeguarding concerns remained, incidents of a safeguarding nature \nhad reduced in both frequency and intensity and it was clear that the person in the \ncharge and the staff tea m were working to ensure that safeguarding was promoted.  \nThe inspector met with all residents who were using this service on the day of \ninspection. Three of the residents preferred not to speak with the inspector for any \nlength of time and the three remain ing residents spent a period of time chatting \nabout their lives and the support which was offered to them. Two residents met \nindividually with the inspector in a communal reception room and they spoke freely \nabout the care and support they each received. B oth residents complimented the \nstaff team and the person in charge and they explained that they had no \nreservations in discussing with staff any concerns which they may have.  \nOne resident explained how they planned to visit their family later in the day and \nthat they planned to stop for breakfast enroute. They explained how they enjoyed \nspending time in the centre and they had every opportunity to get out and about in \nthe local community. They discussed their life before moving to the centre and they \nexplained that it was a very positive move for them. The second resident also spoke \nat length about their life and again they discussed how moving to the centre had \nenhanced their wellbeing and welfare. They had a love of soccer and they chatted \nabout their fa vourite team and they proudly wore their team's colours. They planned \nto go out with the support of staff later that day and maybe place a bet on an \nupcoming soccer match. They explained how they loved having the freedom to pop \nin and to place a bet and re turn home to watch the match. They also discussed how \nthey might stop for a coffee with staff and relax and maybe do some shopping.  \n\n \nPage 6 of 16 \n The remaining resident met with the inspector in their own self contained \napartment.

The \nindividual apartments were found to be cosy in nature and residents had them \ndecorated in line with their personal inter ests with items such as personal \nachievements and pictures of family and their favourite music stars.  \nOverall, the inspector found that the wellbeing and welfare of residents was actively \npromoted and the provider and the staff team aimed to promote reside nts' rights \nand their personal development.  \n \n \nCapacity and capability  \n  \n \n \nThe provider had ensured that the oversight and governance arrangements in this \ncentre were robust.

Both individuals were found to have an \nindepth knowledge of both the service and also of the resources which were in place \nto meet residents' needs. The person in charge attended the service on at least a \nweekl y basis and they were supported in their role by a deputy team leader.  \nThe provider had completed all required audits and reviews of care as set out by the \nregulations with the centre's most recent audit identifying some areas that required \nminor adjustmen ts. The person in charge also had a schedule of internal audits \nwhich assisted in ensuring that areas of care such as medications, fire safety and \npersonal planning would be held to a good standard. The centre's most recent \nannual review had also discussed  the service with both residents and their \nrepresentatives to get their thoughts on the service with an overall positive response \nreceived. In addition, the provider facilitated a weekly governance meeting to review \n\n \nPage 7 of 16 \n any trends of concern which had the pote ntial to impact upon the quality and safety \nof care provided. Although there was good oversight of care practices in this centre, \nthe oversight of incidents required review to ensure that all incidents were promptly \nreviewed by management of the centre.  \nAs mentioned throughout this report, the staff who were present during the \ninspection had a pleasant and caring approach to care.
